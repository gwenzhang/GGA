# General Geometry-aware Weakly Supervised 3D Object Detection

This repo is the official implementation of ECCV24 paper [General Geometry-aware (GGA) Weakly Supervised 3D Object Detection](). Our GGA exhibits promising generalization capabilites, allowing it to be easily extend to various novel scenarios and classes. GGA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 2D bbox-supervised Monocular 3D object Detection. GGA is built on the codebase of [MMDetection3D](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d/tree/dev-1.0).

## News
-[24-07-04] Our GGA is accepted by ECCV'24 ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰, if you find it helpful, please give it a star.  
-[24-07-18] Code of KITTI is released.

## Overview  


## TODO  
- [x] Release the code of KITTI.  
- [ ] Release the arXiv version.  
- [ ] Release the pseudo labels.  
- [ ] Release more detail results.
